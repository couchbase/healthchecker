Sizing report for cbhealthchecker tool
=======================================

We will characterize sizing related factors into five categories for a couchbase cluster.

 - Memory
 - Disk size
 - Disk IO
 - CPU
 - Data distribution

Memory
---

 1. Available Memory (RAM) > 2GB reserved for erlang process
 2. Current usage of Memory (RAM)
 3. *Amount of memory grown for past 3 months, 6 months, 9 months.
 4. Active/Replica resident ratio for doc data, index data,
 5. Cache-miss ratio increased by X%
 6. Available swap space
 7. Current usage of swap space

Disk size
---------

 1. Available Disk space  2~3 times of total data size
 2. Current usage of Disk space
 3. *Amount of data grown for past 3 months, 6 months, 9 months.
 4. doc size / view size
 5. *List of Volumes [HDD/SSD/EC2 or different Volumes]
 6. data path / index path / install path
 7. number of items

Disk IO performance
-------

  1. read/write/delete ops, ratio to categorize application type (read extensive or write extensive)
  2. avg value size  r/w/d in mb/s
  3. write queue length
  4. *DGM

CPU
---

 1. *Available CPU
 2. Current usage of CPU
 3. *number of cpu cores, >=4 (# of xdcr streams + # design docs ) * # of buckets


Data distribution
----

 1. *Failover capacity : #node - # replica


Sizing presentation in report
=============================

In the current report, we have a section for node list. For each node record, we can add a sizing column for the node. A nested sizing table can show/hide when clicking the node row.

The sizing table contains three columns as Category, Counter and Value. The category will show values as RAM, Disk size, Disk IO, CPU and Data distribution.
Counters which belong to same category will be grouped together.
